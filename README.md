# Brainobrain Center Landing Page

This repository contains the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a **Brainobrain center landing page**. The page includes:

- Hero section highlighting the center’s benefits
- Programs for different age groups (4-14 years)
- Testimonials and success stats
- Free trial booking form
- Google Maps embed showing the center’s location
- Optional AI Assistant for parent queries
- Mobile-friendly and responsive design

This project is ready to deploy on **GitHub Pages** to get a live URL for the center. It’s designed to be modular so AI integration or additional features can be easily added.
